1. I work with Cole in order to understand the definition of each subroutine. I wanted to make sure that I had the right idea going in before making any mistakes that would slow me down in the long run. Cole helped me understand the ideas of MatrixDeterminant and also MatrixInverse, because after reading the lab manual I was still a bit confused as to how to do them (mentally).

2. I had a good time working this the lab. Usually I have a slow start, but thanks to the lecture notes and video that Professor Dunne put up, I was able to get a good idea as to what I should do in this lab and also how I should start. What was important to me was just learning how to build the test harness. I learned how to build each function quite easily, but was pretty confused as to what a test harness looked like. After sitting down with Max on this, he gave me a pretty good idea as to what I should build as my harness. This lab is different because it gives us some open space to make our programs without having to be tied down to any rule.

3. I started this lab from the bottom up. I worked on the programs first, making sure that they would run before making my harness and their cases (that worked well). If I were to do it again, I would try and use simplier lines of code and make it easier to read. I worked with Cole as I was confused as to how MatrixDeterminant and Inverse were suppose to work, but thats it.

4. I spent about all week doing the lab (about 5-6 hours a day) and it was worth it as I was able to learn how functions work and how they combined with one aother. I liked the fact that in this lab we got to build subroutines and then put them together to make one big program. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact of making the test harnesses, as it was new and a bit weird to me for the first time :P. Everything worked well in the manual except for the fact that parts such as how we should make Submatrix work were a bit confusing, but overall, I really enjoyed it!. The material that we covered in class helped me with the lab and the hardest part, for me was just timing, as I was slow to make the test harnesses since I wasn't sure what to put :( In terms of grade distribution I think that the points are well managed and designated as it focues on the core subroutines and their functions and the lab manual, as well as online examples of the Matrix operations (especially inverse and scalar) were quite helpful in learning simpleir matrix functions!
